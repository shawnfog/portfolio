          <h3>REST & SOAP (CWS) API Testing</h3>
          <b>REST API - Postman</b>
          <p>Provide technical support for REST API issues. Testing of the API calls using Postman. Assisting the Development team by performing
          exploratory testing and validating / reproduction of customer reported bugs.</p>
          <b>Content Web Service (CWS) - SOAPUI</b>
          <p>Support technical issues and test using a combination of SOAPUI for rapid prototyping / debugging as well as Visual Studio (C Sharp).
          We provide a set of web service description languages that can be added to VS via "add service reference" interface so that the API can be
          called and leveraged right within your own C# programs. With the SOAPUI, I can generate test cases and perform load testing. The raw SOAP
          interface of this tool is ideal for troubleshooting purposes as I can inspect the exact xml / SOAP envelope syntax and behavior in this way.</p>

          <h3>PHP Web App Migration Project</h3>
          <p>I maintain a tool that presents lists of support tickets that are coming up for peer review based on a specific criteria. This web app
          uses PHP to update, join and retrieve data from 2 separate SQL Databases. It uses HTML5, CSS and Javascript on the frontend for the rest of
          the the presentation and dynamic features. It also utilizes the datatables framework for easy display of the data.
          </p>
          <p>
          Lead a a project to migrate and integrate a Peer Review web application into a larger Reporting internal application. Collaborated with other
          programmers to successfully complete the project. This allowed continued operation and support of the app which is used by dozens of technical
          support teams across the company to help improve quality of support.<p>
          <b>Summary of the tasks involved in this process are:</b><br>
          Used BCP scripts to migrate database tables and data into the new database.<p>
          Install sqlsrv_connect Microsoft PHP extension in the new environment.<p>
          Refactored the code as needed to update DB connection specifics and to make the code aware of which environment it is running in so it
          can detect those differences (QA, Prod).<p>
          Add new button on the main page to allow the Peer Review app to be accessible from within the larger app.<p>
          Modified stylesheet to adapt appearance to to confirm to the new application.<p>
          New Feature: Added button to automatically populate review score and save it to the associated ticket in the ticketing system.<p>
        </p>
